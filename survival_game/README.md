# Mystical Forest Survival

A simple 2D survival game built with HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript, running in the browser.

## How to Play

*   **Objective:** Survive as many days as possible!
*   **Controls:**
    *   **Move:** Use `WASD` or `Arrow Keys`.
    *   **Attack (Night Only):** Press the `E` key to attack nearby monsters (Trees, Rocks). Note: Lumberjack cannot be killed.
*   **Gameplay:**
    *   **Daytime:** Collect food (Rabbits, Pigs, Golden Chickens) by running over them to increase your score (life). Avoid the Dogs that chase and attack!
    *   **Nighttime:** Survive! Trees grow and can fall on you. Rocks roll down towards you. A dangerous Lumberjack appears from Night 1 onwards and will kill you instantly! Collect Golden Eggs (outside the fence) for bonus points.
    *   **Score:** Your score acts as your health (starts at 50). Collect food to increase it. Getting hit by Dogs, Rocks, or falling Trees decreases it. If the score reaches 0 or the Lumberjack hits you, the game is over.
    *   **Fence:** Food animals (Rabbits, Pigs, Golden Chickens) spawn and stay within the fenced area.
*   **Restart:** If you lose, click the "Restart" button.
*   **Music:** Use the speaker button (ðŸ”Š/ðŸ”‡) in the top-right corner to toggle music.
